### Code Structure

- `googleCalendarAPI.ts` - Google Calendar API integration
- `codeBlockProcessor.ts` - Markdown code block processor for rendering
- `dateInputModal.ts` - Modal for selecting dates
- `oauthServer.ts` - OAuth authentication server

## Privacy & Security

- All authentication is handled through Google's official OAuth 2.0 flow
- No calendar data is stored permanently; it's fetched on-demand
- Access tokens are stored locally in Obsidian's plugin data
- The plugin only requests read access to your calendar events

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

- Ensure your Google Cloud Project has the Calendar and Task API enabled
- Verify your Client ID and Client Secret are entered correctly
- Make sure your OAuth consent screen is properly configured

### Calendar Not Loading

- Check if you have internet connectivity
- Verify your Google account has access to the calendars you want to import
- Try re-authenticating by clearing the stored tokens in plugin settings
